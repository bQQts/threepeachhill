bookstore_Lamp_4455468b		Surveying the shattered lamp yields nothing I didn't already suspect. The glass lampshade was a mosaic of shades of blue stained glass pieces welded together at the seams.	game/script files/1_bookstore.rpy	131	"[what]"
bookstore_Lamp_61d562aa		Four panels had joined at their long edges to create a lampshade reminiscent of a boxy, blue, crystalline moth.	game/script files/1_bookstore.rpy	133	"[what]"
bookstore_Lamp_1cc44244		Now, the intricate panels are shattered, the floor a dazzling array of blue edges. The electrical fixture, too, is bent at an odd angle.	game/script files/1_bookstore.rpy	135	"[what]"

lamp_grab_36e6c337		Her face is so close. Her eyes are a warm brown that reminds me of hot chocolate, or perhaps the old walnut table upstairs. It's a familiar, comfortable shade.	game/script files/1_bookstore.rpy	184	"[what]"
lamp_freeze_4ac4678c		It takes my brain a moment to catch up to what's happening, and by the time I realize what she's doing, it's too late.	game/script files/1_bookstore.rpy	193	"[what]"

lamp_freeze_4cb6fcb6		Finally, she stops fiddling with the broken shards. She clutches her bleeding finger and looks up at me.	game/script files/1_bookstore.rpy	203	"[what]"

deal_08af55a5		She says it with conviction. You let go of her and cross your arms.	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	7	"[what]"

deal_0d496241	a	"You can call me Aya."	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	27	a "[what]"
deal_2e8ca6ff		You step gingerly past the lamp to grab the broom and dustpan from an alcove next to the front door and hand her the implements.	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	29	"[what]"
deal_7f346645	a	"You could start by sweeping up all these pieces. Try not to miss any! I actually do have an idea for how we could fix it, but we'll need as many of the pieces as possible."	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	31	a excited "[what]"
deal_db6581b6	e	Erin looks doubtful.	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	33	e neutral "[what]"

lamp_freeze_bandage_cde5a46c	e	"Thank you, I'm sorry for the trouble."	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	53	e gloom "[what]"
lamp_freeze_bandage_2a285bf1		You flick off the neon OPEN sign at the front door, grabbing a dry erase marker to scribble out a note that says "Back at 12:45", which you stick to the front door itself.	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	55	"[what]"
lamp_freeze_bandage_c8aa62ee		You both quickly wash your hands at the bathroom sink and return to the front counter. You reach under it and pull out a first aid kit, removing iodine, gauze, tweezers, and a small bandage.	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	57	"[what]"
lamp_freeze_bandage_681376e0		She winces as you press the iodine-soaked gauze into the wound but does not pull away. It only takes a minute to finish treating and bandaging the cut.	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	59	"[what]"
lamp_freeze_bandage_5c70052c	a	"This shouldn't leave a scar, just be sure to keep it clean and dry."	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	61	a sad "[what]"
lamp_freeze_bandage_606d414e	e	"Thank you, Aya."	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	63	e blush "[what]"

lamp_freeze_bandage_555541ba		You shake your head and clear your throat softly.	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	69	"[what]"
lamp_freeze_bandage_8c40995e	a	"Okay. Let's get that glass cleaned up before any more visitors come in. I'll... move the peaches, too."	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	71	a tsuntsun "[what]"
deal_cont_980fe205		You pop into the back to find a bucket.	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	77	"[what]"
deal_cont_ee9e74e2	a	"Put the pieces in this. I'm going to go look something up."	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	79	a neutral "[what]"
deal_cont_bccef63d		As Erin collects the pieces, you fetch the address book from the front counter and flip through it. "Book" is a generous descriptor for this mishmash.	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	81	"[what]"
deal_cont_3529b5a5		It's a huge leather binder that's been stuffed full of additional sheaves of paper, parchment, newspaper ad clippings, and even some pressed leaves inscribed with nearly illegible writings.	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	83	"[what]"
deal_cont_54e002ea		These are notes, contacts, fliers, and advertisements from all manner of local business, both human and spirit. Your parents added their notes when they took over the shop, and you've added a few of your own over the years.	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	85	"[what]"
deal_cont_aab251a7	a	(There must be somebody in here who could fix the lamp.)	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	87	a neutral "[what]"
deal_cont_65b187c0		The bookshop's vibey music is accented by the sounds of pages flipping and glass pieces clinking as Erin sweeps them up.	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	94	"[what]"
deal_cont_9d2dac18	e	"Hey, Aya?"	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	96	e neutral "[what]"
deal_cont_4600b2e7		(There! I've got it!)	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	98	"[what]"
deal_cont_c7953f09		I pin a no-longer-sticky sticky note with an index finger so the little fan doesn't blow it away while I write in thick marker on a blank page from a nearby notebook. I reply distractedly,	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	100	"[what]"
deal_cont_2328f8ec	a	"Yeah?"	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	102	a neutral "[what]"
deal_cont_f593636c		Erin walks over, setting the bucket of lamp pieces on the countertop. She brushes a few loose strands of hair from her face, tucking them behind her ears, then bends to the counter to prop her weight up on her elbows.	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	104	"[what]"
deal_cont_26c38252	e	"Whatever solution you're thinking of had better be magic, because I don't know anyone who could put together all those tiny pieces in a way that fits right. It's pretty busted."	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	106	e gloom "[what]"
deal_cont_26b911db		Her voice is hesitant and full of regret.	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	108	"[what]"
deal_cont_fee8b366	a	"Well, you're right about that."	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	110	a sad "[what]"
deal_cont_4169d6dd		I finish writing the last few words and sign the bottom of the page with a flourish before sliding the sheet over to Erin.	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	113	"[what]"
deal_cont_d701b5db		She peers at the page, brows furrowed cutely in concentration.	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	117	"[what]"

deal_cont_ce7e0ad9	a	"We should be able to find a spell that fixes lamps there, and I don't intend to be the one who pays for it."	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	125	a happy "[what]"
deal_cont_d779e269		Erin gulps.	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	127	"[what]"

deal_cont_2a80700d	a	"No, no, nothing like that. Just regular money. Most spirits in the modern era use human currency to keep things simple,"	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	133	a excited "[what]"
deal_cont_5576a8b0	a	"...though it's possible to find the odd esoteric spirit who wants weird ingredients, favors, or labor as their exchange rate."	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	135	a "[what]"

deal_cont_b7e9a120	a	"It's not really the Other Side, which is what you're referring to. It's more of a liminal space between the two worlds."	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	141	a neutral "[what]"
deal_cont_3b1a38c1	a	"It's easy to travel between worlds through the market as long as you've made a deal before you go. If you don't... the Lost Market keeps you until you do."	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	143	a "[what]"

deal_cont_87d960ba		She waggles a finger at me.	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	153	"[what]"

deal_cont_8f1626d5		My ear twitches and I shrug.	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	157	"[what]"
deal_cont_5ef67fa6	a	"It'll be fine! Anyway, if you're that broke you should probably pay better attention to your surroundings so you don't accidentally break peoples' stuff."	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	159	a happy "[what]"
deal_cont_5cc37e52		I'm mostly joking. We both know it wasn't really her fault. She takes it in stride.	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	161	"[what]"
deal_cont_84020dfb		She reads the contract very carefully, and I feel a sense of approval about the care she's taking. Always know what you're signing up for.	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	163	"[what]"
deal_cont_eb3656ff		She might be a bit clumsy, but she's not a fool. After a couple of minutes, she nods and sets the paper down.	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	165	"[what]"

deal_cont_0aae87a4		She pulls out her phone, presumably to check her calendar, and bites her lip. It's more distracting than I care to admit.	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	177	"[what]"

deal_cont_03aff38a	a	"Basically, if you decide to bail, there will be a karmic consequence. This isn't a big pact, so even if you do decide to bail it won't be too drastic. But I still suggest you try to keep your word."	game/script files/2_deal.rpy	204	a neutral "[what]"

pursuit_0192f78d		The next week is much less eventful. The air is as humid as ever. The cicadas continue to play their summer soundtrack. Finally, a totally open weekend comes calling.	game/script files/3_cobblercornerstore.rpy	14	"[what]"
cobbler_e0f3d784		Fortunately, the peaches had sustained no damage at all during The Incident, and I'm able to whip up a couple of test cobblers.	game/script files/3_cobblercornerstore.rpy	33	"[what]"
cobbler_559f6c97		The local peaches aren't quite in season yet, so these are just some of the early bloomers that Joy at the orchard set aside for me.	game/script files/3_cobblercornerstore.rpy	35	"[what]"
cobbler_ff164c88		The cobblers aren't bad. They're not as sweet as I had hoped they'd be, but that makes sense since peach season starts next month.

cobbler_ca91709d		I divide the cobblers into plastic food storage bins and pack a small picnic basket with the bins I don't put in the fridge. Some of my older friends will probably love this.	game/script files/3_cobblercornerstore.rpy	39	"[what]"

orchardist_19c4a191		We run into each other now and then, and we're friends on social media. She's a much more active poster than I am, and the extra marketing has been helpful for her orchard. People come from all over to pick peaches.	game/script files/3_cobblercornerstore.rpy	53	"[what]"

orchardist_b243b2b7		I take my bike to her office, which is a small two-story building at the very foot of the orchard's hills. Wind chimes hang from the stoop, and the sign on the door says OPEN.
