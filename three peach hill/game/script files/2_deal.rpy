# 2. The Deal - Erin makes a pact with a spirit, and is surprisingly cool with it
label Deal:

    e "\"I broke it, so I should fix it.\""

    "She says it with conviction. I let go of her and cross my arms."

    a "\"And how are you going to fix it? By picking up broken glass with your bare hands?\""

    "The girl blushes."

    e "\"Let me pay you for it, then.\""

    a "\"It's not something I can replace that easily.\""

    e "\"Humor me, how much?\""

    "I snort and give her a number that makes her eyes bulge."

    e "\"I-I, uh, I can't pay that now but let me write you an IOU. And... I can leave something as collateral. Does that work...?\""

    a "First, what's your name?"

    e "\"Oh, right. I'm Erin. Erin Marten. And you are...?\""

    a "\"You can call me Aya.\""

    "I step past the lamp to grab the broom and dustpan from an alcove next to the front door."

    a "\"You could start by sweeping up all these pieces. Try not to miss any! I actually do have an idea for how we could fix it.\""

    "Erin looks doubtful."

    e "\"Really...?\""

    e "\"Thank you, I'm sorry for the trouble.\""

    "I turn off the neon OPEN sign at the front door, grabbing a dry erase marker to scribble out a note that says \"Back at 12:45\", which I stick to the front door."

    "We quickly wash our hands at the bathroom sink and return to the front counter. I reach under it and pull out a first aid kit, removing iodine, gauze, tweezers, and a small bandage."

    "She winces as I press the iodine-soaked gauze into the wound but does not pull away. It only takes a minute to finish treating and bandaging the cut."

    a "\"This shouldn't leave a scar, just be sure to keep it clean and dry.\""

    e "\"Thank you... Aya.\""

    "For some reason, I really like the sound of my name from her lips."

    "What am I thinking? I shake my head to clear the thought from my mind, and clear my throat softly."

    a "\"Okay. Let's get that glass cleaned up before any more visitors come in.\""

label deal_cont:
    
    "I grab a bucket from the back and hand it to Erin."

    a "\"Put the pieces in this. I'm going to go look something up.\""

    "As Erin collects the pieces, I go get the address book from the front counter and start flipping through it. \"Book\" is a term used loosely in this context."
    
    "It's a huge leather binder that's been stuffed full of additional sheaves of paper, parchment, newspaper ad clippings, and even some pressed leaves inscribed with nearly illegible writings."

    "These are notes, contacts, fliers, and advertisements from all manner of local, both human and spirit. My parents added their notes when they took over the shop, and I've added a few of my own over the years."

    "I'm sure there's somebody in here who could fix the lamp."

    "The bookshop's lounge music is accented by the sounds of pages flipping and glass clinking as we work away."

    e "\"Hey, Aya?\""

    "I pin a loose sheaf with an index finger so the little fan doesn't blow it away while I write in thick marker on a blank page from a nearby notebook. I reply distractedly,"

    a "\"Yeah?\""

    "Erin walks over, setting the bucket of lamp pieces on the countertop. XX She brushes a few loose strands of hair from her face, tucking them behind her ears, then bends to the counter to prop her weight up on her elbows."

    e "\"Whatever solution you're thinking of had better be magic, because I don't know anyone who could put together all those tiny pieces in a way that fits right. It's... pretty busted.\""

    "Her voice is hesitant and full of regret."

    a "\"Well, you're right about that.\""

    "I finish writing the last few words and sign the bottom of the page with a flourish before sliding the sheet over to Erin."

    "She peers at the page, brows furrowed cutely in concentration."

    e "\"What's this? Is this... a contract?\""

    "My mouth curls into a wry smile, and my tone is gentle when I explain."

    a "\"It's just something simple. Sign it with your true name and it will mean you can accompany me to the Lost Market. We should be able to find a spell that fixes lamps there, and I don't intend to be the one who pays for it.\""

    "Erin gulps."

    e "\"What do I have to pay with? Is it... do I have to pay with, like, blood? Or years off my life? Or my firstborn child? Orâ€”"

    "I interrupt before her imagination takes her farther into a spiral."

    a "\"No, no, nothing like that. Just regular money. Most spirits in the modern era use human currency to keep things simple,\""
    
    a "\"though it's possible to find the odd esoteric spirit who wants weird ingredients, favors, or labor as their exchange rate. But whatever the cost, nothing is ever free.\""

    e "\"So you want me to go with you to the spirit world?"

    a "\"It's not really the Other Side, which is what you're referring to. It's more of a liminal space between the two worlds.\""
    
    a "\"It's easy to travel between worlds through the market as long as you actually make an exchange while there. If you don't... the Lost Market keeps you until you do.\""

    "I see the worried look on her face."

    a "\"Which won't be a problem, since we have a mission!\""

    e "\"O-okay! Will the spell cost the... the same amount you listed earlier? Because I don't think I can pay that...\""

    a "\"Gods, no. It'll cost enough, and you'll be able to cover it. Trust me on that.\""

    "She waggles a finger at me."

    e "\"You don't know just how broke I am. I'm a college student.\""

    "My ear twitches and I shrug."

    a "\"It'll be fine! Anyway, if you're that broke you should probably pay better attention to your surroundings so you don't accidentally break peoples' stuff.\""

    "I'm mostly joking, but also kind of not joking. But she takes it in stride."

    "She reads the contract very carefully, and I feel a sense of approval about the care she's taking. It's always better to be sure about what you're getting into before signing anything."

    "She might be a bit clumsy, but she's not a fool. After a couple of minutes, she nods and sets the paper down."

    e "\"So when do we go?\""

    "I tap a finger against the countertop and think it over."

    a "\"We should be able to go on the night of the autumn equinox. That's when it's pretty much guaranteed to show up. Any other time can be kind of hit or miss."

    e "\"That's like, next month, right?\""

    a "\"Yes, the evening of the 22nd. That a problem?\""

    "She pulls out her phone, presumably to check her calendar, and bites her lip. It's more distracting than I care to admit."

    e "\"It could be... but I said I'd fix your lamp, and that's a promise. I'll make it work. Can I borrow your pen?\""

    "I wordlessly pass her the marker, which has a plastic spoon taped to it. She takes it and signs the bottom of the page."

    "Our signatures ignite in a heatless golden flame that traces the lines of ink."

    "Erin startles."

    e "\"What was that?!\""

    "I laugh, not to mock her but because the surprise on humans' faces never really gets old."

    a "\"It's not a trick or anything, that's just the pact being made! Think of it as a little magical insurance that automatically happens when spirits make agreements.\""
    
    a "\"Basically, if you decide to bail, there will be a karmic consequence. This isn't a big pact, so even if you do decide to bail it won't be too drastic. But I still suggest you try to keep your word.\""

    "She nods and makes a note in her phone."

    e "\"Alright, that makes sense. Then... I guess I'll see you around? Oh wait, let me give you my number.\""

    "I expect her to jot it down on the paper, but she confidently takes my wrist and writes the number there, the marker tickling my skin. She grins."

    e "\"So you don't lose it!\""

    "I blush furiously."

    "Erin rocks back on her heels and does a little spin, walking lightly to the door. Hand poised to open it, she looks back over her shoulder at me."

    e "\"You're beautiful, you know that? Bye!\""

    "My heart flutters and I hesitate, not sure if she means that in an I-love-women way or a complimenting-without-connotations way."
    
    "She notices the heat warning my cheeks, and before I can say anything in response, she ducks out of the store, giggling."

    a "\"Wh... what...!\""
