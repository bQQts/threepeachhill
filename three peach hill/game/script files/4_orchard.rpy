    "Three Peach Hill is an orchard known for its stunning peach trees. Like the name implies, it spans rolling hills. The team of farmers who tend the orchard under Head Orchardist Joy have been quite busy, as the peaches are in season and many of the trees have produced fruit ripe enough to pick."

    "Joy and I have been friends for almost our whole lives. I see her loading her truck with an order of peaches and wave to her as I park my bicycle alongside the orchard's shop. She rolls her shoulders in a languorous stretch and waves back with a big grin."

    "Yesterday she had posted a picture of the first ripe peaches dangling from trees on social media with the caption, \"Peach picking is open! Come by to fill a cart or basket!\""

    "I couldn't make it out here yesterday, but it's a nice Saturday and I had the whole day free. So here I am, on my way to fill a cart of peaches. The pie I'm gonna make out of these is going to be legendary."

    "The farmers at the orchard point me toward the hill where the peaches are available for the public to pick."

    "I'm walking there when I hear her voice."

    "What is Erin doing here?"

    "I see her APPEARANCE XX. She wipes her brow with the back of a work-gloved hand, laughing at something another farmer said. I keep walking."

    e "\"Wait!\"" 

    "She catches my hand and I lurch as she tugs my arm firmly. I throw my body to the side to yank my arm back, but she lets go. The lack of resistance throws me off balance, and I stumble."
