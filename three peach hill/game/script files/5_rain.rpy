# 5. The Rain - Caught in the rain… and there was only one bed? Perchance?

"I finish picking the peaches by myself. By the time I'm done, the remaining daylight is nearly smothered by thick clouds. I hadn't noticed how dense they had gotten, but a brief glance is enough to confirm that they look heavy and full, as if ready to spill at any moment."

"I'm rolling my small cart quickly through the orchard when I feel the first droplets splash my brow, my hair, my hand. It's a long way back to my bike, and then I'll still have to cycle home from there. I don't even have a jacket."

a "\"This is going to suck.\""

"The dirt path quickly turns to mud that sucks at my feet with every step. But still, I keep on, now dragging my mud-caked cart of peaches"

"I slip in a particularly muddy patch and fall. I sit in the mud, contemplating my life. My ankle is definitely sprained. I have no idea how I'm going to get these peaches back. I'm drenched, and I just snapped at a girl I really quite like for really no good reason."

"I close my eyes and tilt my head back, letting the raindrops splash across my face. I take a few deep breaths."

"The rain stops drip-dropping on my face, but I can still hear it around me. I open my eyes."

"It's Erin. She's holding an umbrella over me, looking breathless and disheveled."

e "\"I ran to get an umbrella as soon as I saw how bad the sky was getting. Looks like I didn't make it to you in time though, sorry, Aya. Why are you sitting in the mud? You're soaked through!\""

a "\"Erin...\""

"The shorter woman hands me the umbrella and helps me to my feet."

e "\"Can you walk?\""

a "\"Yes,\""

"I put weight onto my foot and wince."

a "\"Well, no. My ankle...\""

"Erin turns around and crouches, gesturing for me to climb up on her back."

e "\"Get on, I'll carry you.\""

a "\"But I'm taller than you! I'll crush you!\""

e "\"I'm like an ant, I can carry you no problem!\""

a "\"Erin, I'll just lean on you and we'll go slow.\""

e "\"Really, I insist! I'm wearing work boots, I won't slip in the mud. Let me carry you.\""

a "\"What about the peaches?\""

e "\"There will be more peaches. I'm more worried about you right now. Now, climb on.\""

"I climb on, still holding the umbrella in one hand. She hikes me up, grasping below my thighs and leaning forward. My wet hair sticks to her neck. I try not to think about it."

"It takes a while, but we do make it down the big hill. Erin is stronger than she looks, and though she's breathing hard by the time we get back to the entrance of the orchard she hasn't once lost her grip or stumbled."

e "\"Just hang on tight, I'll get you home.\""

"I let the umbrella rest over our backs, which probably makes us look like an overly large beetle, and let the sway of her steps and the sound of her breathing lull me into a half-slumber."

e "\"What's your door code? Aya?\""

"She's hunched over at the side door of the bookshop that leads up to my house."

e "\"Hey, Aya? You okay?\""

"There's concern in her voice and I try to answer, but it comes out as a mumble. I eventually stumble through the words."

a "\"11... 0... 2.\""

"I hear the beep of her punching in the code, and the click of the bolt sliding open."

"She pries the umbrella from my arms and leaves it just inside the front door to dry on the doormat. Most of the mud washed off us from the rain, but we're still drenched."

"She deposits me gently on the entryway bench and peels our dripping shoes and socks off."

e "\"We need to get you clean and dry, let's get upstairs, okay?\""

"We climb the stairs, leaving little puddles behind us."

"My house is still quite warm from the summer day, but dry—dehumidifiers and a little bit of magic always ensure that the house stays dry and relatively cool, to preserve the condition of the books on the first floor."

"Erin looks around for the bathroom, finds it, and leads me over to it."

e "\"Get out of those clothes and into a nice hot shower, okay? I'd help you, but...\""

"There's a faint blush growing brighter on her cheeks that snaps me out of my miserable fugue."

a "\"No! No, it's okay, I got it.\""

"I step in and shut the door behind me. A moment later, I peek out and offer Erin a towel."

a "\"So you can dry off while you wait for your turn.\""

e "\"I can just go home, it's alright.\""

a "\"It's pouring out there! You'll catch a cold. Dry off for now, I'll find you a change of clothes once I'm out of the shower.\""

"Soapy water cleanses my body and the heat clears my mind. I feel the tightness leave stiff muscles. I pat myself dry and wrap a towel tightly around myself, leaving my wet and muddy clothes in one of the two bathroom sinks. Then I crack open the bathroom door to see Erin sitting on the rug with the towel draped over her now-bare shoulders."

"Bare? Shoulders? I glance to a nearby kitchen chair, where her soaking wet shirt is hanging. A dish towel on the floor catches the water dripping off of the discarded clothing. I clear my throat and she turns her head to look at me."

a "\"Bathroom's open, your turn, I'll get you some clothes, DON'T LOOK AT ME!\""

"I hobble across the hall to my bedroom and swing the door shut before digging out a t-shirt and sweatpants for myself, and another tee and pair of drawstring shorts that should probably fit Erin."

"When I'm dressed, I take the extra clothes and knock on the bathroom door."

e "\"Almost done!\""

a "\"Take your time, I'm just setting some clothes for you by the door.\""

"When Erin comes out, I have an instant kettle heating water for tea and an ice pack on my ankle, which I've propped up on a second kitchen chair."

e "\"Thank you, the clothes fit well!\""

"My clothes are, in fact, too big on her. The effect is absolutely adorable. She has a hand towel draped over top of her head, and the shirt is long enough that it almost covers the cotton shorts."

a "\"It's no trouble. I'll start some laundry, just check your pockets before I put it in the machine.\""

e "\"I appreciate that, but you should just sit there and rest your ankle. I'll start it for you, just tell me if there's anything special about the machine, okay?\""

a "\"You carried me all the way here. The least I can do is wash your wet clothes.\""

"Despite my protests, she opens a couple of doors until she finds the little room with the washer and dryer."

e "\"You need to rest! I'll tie you down if I need to! Wait here.\""

"I can practically feel her smile on my back."

"Eventually, the patter of the rain on the roof lulls me until I can't keep myself awake any longer. I fall into a dreamless sleep."

"This feels... right."
