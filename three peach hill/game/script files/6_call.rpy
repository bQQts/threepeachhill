    "I'm filling a glass of water when I hear Erin's muffled voice. She must be out on the balcony, and by the sound of it, she's having a not-very-fun conversation."

    "When she comes inside, she seems deflated."

    a "\"Who was that?\""

    e "\"My parents. They want me to come back to the city.\""

    "My stomach drops."

    a "\"I see. So... are you going?\""

    e "\"Sigh. I haven't decided yet, to be honest. It's nice out here, and...\""

    "She looks sidelong at me through lowered lashes."

    e "\"I've found somewhere I like being, rather than just existing somewhere I don't really care about.\""

    "Oh. Oh."

    a "\"But... what about finishing college?\""

    e "\"There are other ways. I could postpone it, or do it online. Anyway, the point is that I'm not really ready to go back to the city. I don't want to go.\""

    a "\"But what about your parents?\""

    e "\"What about them? I appreciate that they want to look out for me, but I'm doing just fine. I'm not doing anything wrong by trying to be happy.\""

    a "\"That's pretty compelling.\""

    e "\"Right?\""

    "I can't help myself. I reach out and rub her shoulder."

    a "\"I'm glad you found somewhere you want to be. Belonging somewhere is something everyone needs, humans and spirits alike.\""

    "She beams at me."

    "That's when I get a call myself. One that dooms me in a way I was totally unprepared for."
