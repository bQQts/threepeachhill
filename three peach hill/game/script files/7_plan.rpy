    a shocked "\"What do you mean they want us to close the bookstore?!\""

    "Erin's eyes go wide and she looks horrified."

    a "\"I told you, I'm not closing it! I'll figure something out. Tell them I said that.\""

    "I end the call and shove my phone into the pocket of my sweatpants."

    e shocked "\"Why would the store close? Doesn't your family own it?\""

    a sad "\"We do own it, but there was a problem with a malicious spirit about half a century ago. My parents made a deal with a more powerful entity to ward the store, but it seems like they neglected to pay it back in full.\""

    e neutral "\"What's left to pay?\""

    a gloom "\"About ten thousand dollars. Due before the new year.\""

    e "\"That's not too bad...\""

    "I scoff."

    a "\"Ten thousand in a small town is not a terribly small number, Erin.\""

    e happy "\"Well, I could help you!\""

    a neutral "\"How?\""

    e excited "\"I'm studying marketing. I can come up with a plan that'll bring in more business. We could even find some donors who want to invest in the bookstore and would cover that cost.\""

    a "\"I had no idea. Do you really think we could pull that off?\""

    "My brow furrows, and my ears lie flat against my head."

    "She frowns a little and reaches up to smooth my brow with a gentle thumb."

    e "\"Don't worry. We'll get you sorted, no problem.\""

    "We spend the rest of the afternoon drawing up a plan."

    "Erin finishes jotting down notes in the composition notepad I grabbed from my desk."

    e happy "\"And that's how we'll do it.\""

    a neutral "\"I'm willing to give it a try. Thank you for doing this, Erin.\""

    e "\"It's no problem! Like I said, this is my thing.\""

    e neutral "\"Anyway... I should probably get going. Gotta get a change of clothes for my shift at the cornerstore later."

    a sad "\"Yeah. Before you go, I just wanted to apologize for how I acted back... before the rain. That wasn't fair, and you were right."

    "She smiles a little."

    a neutral "\"And... thank you again for bringing me home safe and sound.\""

    e happy "\"Apology accepted. And, I'd do it again in a heartbeat.\""

    "I wave a hand at her to brush off the praise."

    "She starts down the road, spinning around at the corner to wave at me one more time."

    "She said she likes being here, and she's quickly entwining herself in different parts of my life. It's... really sweet."

    "It might still be a little risky, but maybe liking Erin is worth the risk."
