    e "\"Well, I could help you!\""

    a "\"How?\""

    e "\"I'm studying marketing. I can come up with a plan that'll bring in more business. We could even find some donors who want to invest in the bookstore and would cover that cost.\""

    a "\"I had no idea. Do you really think we could pull that off?\""

    "My brow furrows, and my ears lie flat against my head."

    "She frowns a little and reaches up to smooth my brow with a gentle thumb."

    e "\"Don't worry. We'll get you sorted, no problem.\""

    "We spend the rest of the afternoon drawing up a plan."

    a "\"Yeah. Before you go, I just wanted to apologize for how I acted back... before the rain. That wasn't fair, and you were right."

    "She starts down the road, spinning around at the corner to wave at me one more time."

    "She said she likes being here, and she's quickly entwining herself in different parts of my life. It's... really sweet."

    "It might still be a little risky, but maybe liking Erin is worth the risk."
