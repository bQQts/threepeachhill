    a "\"What do you mean they want us to close the bookstore?!\""

    "Erin's eyes go wide and she looks horrified."

    a "\"I told you, I'm not closing it! I'll figure something out. Tell them I said that.\""

    "I end the call and shove my phone into the pocket of my sweatpants."

    e "\"Why would the store close? Doesn't your family own it?\""

    a "\"We do own it, but there was a problem with a malicious spirit about half a century ago. My parents made a deal with a more powerful entity to ward the store, but it seems like they neglected to pay it back in full.\""

    e "\"What's left to pay?\""

    a "\"About ten thousand dollars. Due before the new year.\""

    e "\"That's not too bad...\""

    "I scoff."

    a "\"Ten thousand in a small town is not a terribly small number, Erin.\""

    e "\"Well, I could help you!\""

    a "\"How?\""

    e "\"I'm studying marketing. I can come up with a plan that'll bring in more business. We could even find some donors who want to invest in the bookstore and would cover that cost."

    a "\"I had no idea. Do you really think we could pull that off?\""

    "My brow furrows, and my ears lie flat against my head."

    "She frowns a little and reaches up to smooth my brow with a gentle thumb."

    e "\"Don't worry. We'll get you sorted, no problem.\""

    "We spend the rest of the afternoon drawing up a plan."
