    "Erin didn't show up at the usual meeting time. I wait 20 minutes."

    "Twenty minutes turns into an hour, then two. She's not answering her phone."

    "I check near the bookstore. She's not there."

    "I call the cornerstore and the orchard office, and am told she's not there either."

    "I bite my lip. I'm starting to worry that something has happened."

    "At home, I put on a jacket and sneakers and pace in the front room, trying to decide where to start looking for her."

    "There's a knock at the door, and I run to open it."

    a "\"Erin? Oh, Lydia! What are you doing here?\""

    "It's not who I was hoping it would be, and judging by Lydia's expression, I'm not about to be happy that she's here either."

    lyd "\"You haven't found a spell to fix that lamp yet, right?\""

    "I run faster than I ever have before. My legs and lungs burn, and I gasp for air, but I push through it and finally make it to the entrance."

    "The entrance to the Lost Market always looks like a really, really, REALLY long, dark alleyway with floating lights at the far end of it."

    "It doesn't usually pose a risk to humans, since you have to be a spirit or in a pact with a spirit to be able to see it at all."

    "And if you can't see it, it can't see you back."

    "I slow down and start walking down the alley. It's actually faster to walk than it is to run. It's tricky like that."

    "The floating lights start to illuminate faint edges of structures in the alleyway; the ground, the brick walls, loose rocks, some cardboard boxes."

    "The amber glow grows, and I step out of the alley into a street full of spirits of all shape and size."

    "As naturally as breathing, I shift fully into my spirit form. I sniff the air and stretch out each leg, feeling my paws against the cool ground."

    "Tall, shapeless giants and tiny floating imps float alongside animal spirits like myself."

    "I don't waste any time."

    "I run, weaving through the silent crowd, following the faint, unmistakable scent of human and the citrus and apple scent of Erin's shampoo."

    "I have to find her."
